# Clinical Performance Assessment Multi-Agent System

This project implements a multi-agent system using LangChain to analyze clinical performance assessment data. The system processes CSV data containing student evaluations and responds to natural language queries about performance in various clinical domains.

## Overview

The system consists of seven specialized agents that work together to:
1. Parse clinical performance data
2. Understand natural language queries
3. Perform numeric and text analysis
4. Generate comprehensive responses

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (with access to GPT-4o)
- Required packages (specified in requirements.txt)

## Installation

- Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the System
python main.py

### Examplem Queries
- "What are my three strengths and two areas for improvement in clinical reasoning?"
