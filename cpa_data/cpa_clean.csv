She the most helpful medical student I've met in [REDACTED] all of the relative medical tasks like calling consults, updating patient's, [REDACTED] evaluations, placing orders and writing notes but she also was extremely helpful at [REDACTED] tasks for the entire team's patients. [REDACTED] was a great team player. Our team would reflect asking ourselves, “what would we have done without her here?” at [REDACTED] a busy day. She often worked side by side [REDACTED] residents and she took [REDACTED] role of a sub-I or intern on [REDACTED]. For presentations, her plans were always reasonable, at [REDACTED] course correction [REDACTED] missed conversations while out taking care of patients. [REDACTED] was invested from [REDACTED]’t miss [REDACTED]. She does flush out a full differential diagnosis, running her first pass plan, then appropriately course correcting with new information. Easily adapted to feedback about presentations for complex medicine patients, [REDACTED] work through difficult presentations, [REDACTED] improve organization. For example, problem list [REDACTED] to be reoriented for very complicated patients and decompensating patients. This will get easier with experience. For straight forward patients however, she gave superb assessment and plans.","[REDACTED] should continue to work on streamlining her presentations and note writing to only include the most pertinent details that the entire team should know. One piece of advice that I received that helped me a lot in [REDACTED] “Don’t teach me, just convince me.” A listener can assess for level of understanding/medical knowledge in a presentation or a note by simply seeing what evidence was used to support the proposed decisions. For example, for a patient [REDACTED] [REDACTED]’s, you [REDACTED] need to talk through the results of a dexamethasone suppression test or, in [REDACTED] [REDACTED] need to “teach” the listener [REDACTED] interpret the test. Thus, in [REDACTED] you would report the test value and [REDACTED][REDACTED] plan you could say something like “cortisol appropriately suppressed with dexamethasone, making [REDACTED]’s syndrome much less likely”. In [REDACTED] listener will know that you understand how the test works[REDACTED] appropriately interpret the values. This example leaves out the extra words that many people would naturally want to say during a presentation (including myself!) that end up “teaching” the listener like “Since cortisone naturally peaks [REDACTED][REDACTED][REDACTED], a low AM cortisol level after a dexamethasone dose shows that cortisol production was suppressed by the dexamethasone. This would be expected [REDACTED][REDACTED] hormonal axis. Since we did the test to look for [REDACTED]’s … etc etc”. If you worry about being too brief with this approach, remember that he listener or note reader can always ask for more clarification on your though process if they want/need it. The best time to really spell out your thoughts during a presentation or a note is when you are breaking from [REDACTED] or doing something more unconventional. For example, give a full sentence as to why a person [REDACTED][REDACTED] on goal directed medical therapy (allergies, didn’t tolerate the side effects, etc), or why are you choosing a non standard antibiotic regimen (multiple recent hospitalizations at [REDACTED] of growing a really resistant bug) or why a patient [REDACTED] cough doesn’t have a CXR (scared of the X ray machine and refuses, cannot be properly positioned). As you move through different rotations and different teams, consider asking each attending [REDACTED] resident [REDACTED] to hear about chronic problems [REDACTED][REDACTED] plan. [REDACTED] do like to hear about them (especially from [REDACTED]) [REDACTED] [REDACTED] for the sake of efficiency. You can conclude your presentation with ""no changes to management of their chronic conditions [REDACTED]"" if the listener only wants active problems. You can ask about preferences for medications, lab values (all vs. just abnormal vs. values we are trending) and studies too. If you [REDACTED] get a clear answer about preferences once asked, a different way to get the same information is to ask "" [REDACTED] have any pet- peeves about presentations?"" These adaptations will help you streamline your presentation and keep the listener engaged from [REDACTED] it's hard to guess everyone's preferences. Additionally, another skill would be to add if a problem is improving, stable or worsening when introducing it. For example, ""acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure - improving, now on 3L nasal canal"" or ""ICU delirium - stable for [REDACTED] without need for restraints"" or ""Acute hypernatremia - worsening 2/2 poor PO intake and no IV access""",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,

One piece of advice that I received that helped me a lot in [REDACTED] “Don’t teach me, just convince me.” A listener can assess for level of understanding/medical knowledge in a presentation or a note by simply seeing what evidence was used to support the proposed decisions. For example, for a patient [REDACTED] [REDACTED]’s, you [REDACTED] need to talk through the results of a dexamethasone suppression test or, in [REDACTED] [REDACTED] need to “teach” the listener [REDACTED] interpret the test. Thus, in [REDACTED] you would report the test value and [REDACTED][REDACTED] plan you could say something like “cortisol appropriately suppressed with dexamethasone, making [REDACTED]’s syndrome much less likely”. In [REDACTED] listener will know that you understand how the test works[REDACTED] appropriately interpret the values. This example leaves out the extra words that many people would naturally want to say during a presentation (including myself!) that end up “teaching” the listener like “Since cortisone naturally peaks [REDACTED][REDACTED][REDACTED], a low AM cortisol level after a dexamethasone dose shows that cortisol production was suppressed by the dexamethasone. This would be expected [REDACTED][REDACTED] hormonal axis. Since we did the test to look for [REDACTED]’s … etc etc”. If you worry about being too brief with this approach, remember that he listener or note reader can always ask for more clarification on your though process if they want/need it. The best time to really spell out your thoughts during a presentation or a note is when you are breaking from [REDACTED] or doing something more unconventional. For example, give a full sentence as to why a person [REDACTED][REDACTED] on goal directed medical therapy (allergies, didn’t tolerate the side effects, etc), or why are you choosing a non standard antibiotic regimen (multiple recent hospitalizations at [REDACTED] of growing a really resistant bug) or why a patient [REDACTED] cough doesn’t have a CXR (scared of the X ray machine and refuses, cannot be properly positioned).",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,

When I gave feedback to another team member about avoiding jargon, I saw [REDACTED] to use simple, clear, lay language with patients. He spoke with an outside vascular surgeon about a patient [REDACTED] DVT after sclerotherapy for varicose veins. His notes were [REDACTED] be used for the team daily progress note--after some editing by the resident/intern. He gave a fantastic teaching presentation on naloxone with clear and easy to understand slides. He also presented brief teaching points on rounds based on reading he had been doing.","[REDACTED] and I talked about the need to make his oral presentations more concise. I explained I like the word ""concise"" because to me that implies both that the presentation is focused and brief, but also that it is thorough and [REDACTED] leave out any critical information. [REDACTED]'s habit is to give additional explanation when he is presenting, but we discussed that saying things like, ""I also listened to his lungs and they sounded clear,"" takes too much time and should be truncated to: [REDACTED]."" Similarly, [REDACTED] should continue to [REDACTED] giving a brief summary of the patient. When he picked up a[REDACTED] float admission on our post call day, he essentially read the HPI from [REDACTED] resident [REDACTED], even though I [REDACTED] do that. I recommend highlighting or underlining the key words [REDACTED] [REDACTED], or simply taking notes on a separate piece of paper about what you plan to say [REDACTED][REDACTED] and then [REDACTED] actually saying it out loud. If possible, record and time yourself so you can can listen to yourself and identify where you could [REDACTED] concise. We also discussed the organization of the A/P [REDACTED][REDACTED]-up. Our resident [REDACTED] intern, put a lot of time and effort into editing the A/P of [REDACTED]'s notes when turning them into the [REDACTED] progress note. It is important to list problems in [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED]-up. It is also important to consider [REDACTED] either ""lump"" problems together because they are closely related, or ""split"" items into separate problems [REDACTED] A/P. We discussed making sure you are very clear about pathophysiology and the mechanisms of the underlying diseases. When a patient [REDACTED][REDACTED], [REDACTED] had clearly done some reading about CHF exacerbations, but he [REDACTED] quite clear [REDACTED] apply the reading he had done to this particular patient. He explained that an intraventricular conduction delay could lead to a heart failure exacerbation, and recommended checking an SPEP. While I'm glad [REDACTED] was reading about CHF, neither of these topics applied to our specific patient. Finally--it is challenging to get back up to speed after [REDACTED] off, but you want to have a systematic way to review notes, talk with nurses, talk with the team, see the patient [REDACTED], etc. [REDACTED] off, [REDACTED] [REDACTED] aware of the change in [REDACTED] of his pts, and one time he had not reviewed a[REDACTED] float note for some important overnight events.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,
